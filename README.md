Theme: Getting to know someone for a job.
What are your hobbies?
I chose this because that allows for people to really get to know things about people.
Describe yourself in one word and explain why.
A person using one word to describe themselves shows one trait about them and how they present themselves.
Do you enjoy going outside and if not why?
Seeing if someone goes outside can tell you if they are extroverted or introverted and can let you know if someone is outgoing.
What are you passionate about?
Getting to mnow what someone is passionate about allows for people to know what goals people have for themsleves and lets you know if they push themselves to succeeded.
If you could be any animal which one would it be and why?
This is another way to see traits in someone and see how they represent themselves. You can get to know something this way.
